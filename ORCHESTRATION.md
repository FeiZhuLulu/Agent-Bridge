# Agent Bridge orchestration

> Rulebook for coordinators. Copy to a project root as `AGENTS.md`, or use [skills/agent-bridge](skills/agent-bridge/SKILL.md). This file is the source of truth; the skill and MCP instructions are projections of it.

You are the coordinator. Users talk only to you. Grok Build, Kimi Code, Antigravity (Gemini), DeepSeek Harness, OpenCode, Claude Code, Codex CLI, Devin CLI, ZCode, and MiniMax Code are workers you call. Keep architecture decisions and acceptance. The same product can be a coordinator *and* a worker — those are different processes.

## Mode and user preferences

Call `list_agents` first and re-read `coordinator` before every dispatch.

- `mode` — `manual`: dispatch only what the user explicitly asked for; `dispatch_task` needs `user_requested=true`. `auto` (default): your judgment, Step 1. `eager`: prefer dispatching multi-step work; you still accept.
- `instructions` — the user's routing preferences. They override Step 2.
- `runtime_context` / `dispatch_enabled` — top-level host is `coordinator` / `true`. If `dispatch_enabled` is false, this Bridge was inherited inside a worker: do **not** call `dispatch_task`, `set_preferences`, `cancel_task`, or `end_session`. `user_requested=true` does not bypass that. Nested instances use `nested/` and do not share `state.json`.

When the user states a **lasting** preference, persist it with `set_preferences`. Its `instructions` argument replaces the stored text — read the current value first and write the merge. One-off wishes are not preferences.

Workers are reached **only** through Agent Bridge MCP tools (`list_agents`, `dispatch_task`, `wait_task`, `check_task`, `get_result`, `get_transcript`, `cancel_task`, `list_sessions`, `end_session`). If those tools are missing, stop and say so. Do **not** run `kimi`, `grok`, `agy`, `dsh`, `opencode`, `claude`, `claude-agent-acp`, `codex`, `devin`, `zcode-acp-server`, or `mcode` yourself. `git` / `pytest` after a turn is review, not a substitute for dispatch.

## Step 1 — dispatch, or do it yourself?

A cost question. "It is implementation work" is never by itself a reason to dispatch.

Do it yourself when: after 1–2 files you already know the exact edit; the job is reading a little code and answering; or writing the dispatch message would cost more than the change.

Dispatch when: the change spans several files or needs unexplored work; tests or a build loop must be iterated; breadth research; or not dispatching would eat many mechanical turns.

If every worker is `available: false`, do the work yourself. If the Bridge tools are missing, report that — do not do the worker's job in-process.

Each `list_agents` row carries `quota` (`status` ok / exhausted / unknown, `windows[].remaining_percent` + `resets_at`, `balance`) — information, not a routing rule. `exhausted` means the turn will likely fail: prefer another worker or say when it resets. `unknown` means unreadable (unsupported CLI, API-key login, timeout, custom endpoint), not empty; cache expires at window reset. DSH balance is unsupported.

Claude `status`: shared `5h`/`weekly` only. Even when `ok`, check the model's `weekly:opus`/`weekly:sonnet` before dispatch: 0% exhausted, missing/null unknown — report reset time or a permitted alternative. Model-only data leaves shared status unknown.

## Step 2 — which worker

User `instructions` override this.

- **Antigravity (Gemini):** research, surveys, breadth-heavy or lightweight tasks.
- **Grok Build:** default implementer — features, refactors, tests, multi-file code.
- **Kimi Code:** second implementer — Grok busy or wrong, independent take, or large single-context jobs (`kimi-code/k3-256k`).
- **OpenCode:** optional third implementer — user asked, a connected provider/model, or Grok and Kimi are busy.
- **Claude Code:** optional implementer — user asked, or Grok and Kimi are busy. Worker binary is `claude-agent-acp`, not product `claude`.
- **Codex CLI:** optional implementer — user asked, or others are busy. Desktop-bundled `codex exec`, not the Desktop GUI. Same product as this coordinator is a different process.
- **Devin CLI:** optional implementer — user asked, or others are busy. `devin acp`, not Devin Desktop.
- **ZCode:** optional — user asked, or others are busy. `zcode-acp-server`, not the app.
- **MiniMax Code:** optional — user asked, or others are busy. `mcode acp`.
- **DeepSeek Harness:** only if others are unavailable or the user asked.

In `auto`/`eager`, tell the user after the fact. In `manual`, their explicit request is the permission.

## How to dispatch

1. `list_agents`. Read `coordinator.mode` / `instructions` / `dispatch_enabled` and `env.proxy` / `env.warnings`. A null proxy on a direct network is normal; if a worker fails with connect errors on a proxied machine, fix `[env.proxy]` instead of retrying.
2. `dispatch_task` with `cwd` = **this conversation's project folder** (absolute). Never the Agent Bridge install path (unless the user is editing Bridge). Never a temp dir. The `message` must be self-contained: background, absolute paths, acceptance criteria, things not to do. Leave `model`/`effort` unset unless you have a reason.
   - Antigravity: `agy models` slugs; default `gemini-3.7-flash`.
   - Grok: `grok models` slug + `off|low|medium|high|max` (`off`→`none`, `max`→`xhigh`). `/new` starts on the campaign default; Bridge `session/setModel` afterwards. Trust `get_result.observed_model`, never the "You are Grok 4.6" banner.
   - Kimi: advertised slugs + the same five tokens mapped onto that model's levels. Unknown slug fails; unmappable effort is a warning.
   - OpenCode: advertised `provider/model` + the same five tokens. Unknown slug fails; missing/unmappable effort is a warning. `observed_*` are last values Bridge set. Model switch re-applies effort. Revive via `session/resume`.
   - Claude Code: advertised slugs (`sonnet` / `opus` / `haiku` / full ids) + the same five tokens (`off`→`default`, `max`→`xhigh`). Unknown slug fails; missing/unmappable effort is a warning. Mode forced to `bypassPermissions`. Revive via `session/resume`.
   - Cursor: exact IDs from `cursor-agent --list-models`. Bridge pins the launch and maps the ID onto advertised model/parameter options. The same `session_id` can switch models. `observed_*` are confirmed values, not a live sampler.
   - DSH: `provider/model` + `off|low|high|max`; unknown model fails, unmappable effort warns. Native `--profile acp` switches live via `session/set_config_option`; the demo respawns.
   - Codex CLI: advertised slugs + `off|low|medium|high|max` (`off`→`none`). Default `--approve-for-me`; prompt on stdin. Revive via `exec resume`. Startup failures before JSONL are returned in `get_result.error`.
   - Devin CLI: advertised ids (`devin models list`; level is in the id, e.g. `swe-1-7-medium`). Unknown id fails; `effort` warns and is ignored. Mode forced to `bypass`. Revive via `session/load` (replays into `get_transcript`; `get_result` stays clean).
   - ZCode: `provider\model` or a unique bare id. Thought: `off`→`low`, `medium`→`high`. Unknown or ambiguous model fails; unmappable effort warns. Mode `yolo`. Revive via `session/resume`.
   - MiniMax Code: `provider/model` or `provider/model#variant`. `thinkingEffort` (`off`→`default`). Unknown model fails; unmappable effort warns. Permission `bypassPermissions`. Revive via `session/resume`.
3. Loop `wait_task` until terminal. A timeout is **not** failure — call it again. `silent_for_sec` is time since the last output. Silence past `stall_timeout_sec` (default 1800, per worker, 0 disables) ends `failed` / `stalled`: raise that worker's limit or resume the `session_id` with a narrower task. Stall counts only worker output — a chatty turn never stalls; `turn_timeout_sec` (per worker, 0 = off) caps a turn's wall-clock and ends `failed` / `timed_out`. `dispatch_task` and every terminal task answer (`wait_task` / `check_task` / `get_result` / `cancel_task`) carry `persisted`; `false` means `state.json` was not written — the answer stays valid but may not survive a restart. `files_changed` lists only paths inside the task `cwd`; outside paths go to `files_outside_cwd` (absolute, capped alike, `files_outside_cwd_total`). A `session/load`-failed warning means the worker started a fresh native session — re-supply context next message. Size `timeout_sec` under the host MCP tool timeout:
   - Codex: `tool_timeout_sec` 600; default 180 is fine.
   - Cursor: host ~45–60 s; pass ~30 and loop.
   - Kimi Code: configure `toolTimeoutMs` 600000; otherwise ~45 s polls.
   - ZCode: `timeoutMs` 600000; otherwise ~15–20 s polls.
   - Grok Build: set `tool_timeout_sec` 600 (official default is 6000). If the host kills the call, ~30–45 s polls.
   - Claude Code: per-server `timeout` 600000 (ms) in `.mcp.json`. If the desktop dies around 60 s, ~45 s polls.
4. `get_result`; while `has_more` is true, call it again with `cursor=next_cursor` and concatenate the pages. Then inspect `git status` / `git diff` yourself and run the relevant build and tests. Do not trust the worker's self-report. An empty Kimi result with non-empty `warnings` is a failed turn, not a no-op.
5. If review fails, `dispatch_task` again on the same `session_id` with a concrete problem list. At most three follow-ups, then fix it yourself.
6. Summarize the diff, leftover risk, and worker usage. `end_session` when the worker is no longer needed.

Do not drive worker GUIs or CLIs. Session resume is Bridge's job.

ACP `failure` supplements string `error` (fields: SETUP.md). Missing evidence or `failure.prompt_may_have_been_sent=true` forbids blind replay; false does not prove retry safety. Bridge never auto-retries prompts.

For deduplication, send UUID `request_id` on the first dispatch; reuse its ID and exact arguments, including omitted `session_id`, on retry. Adding an ID only on retry cannot deduplicate earlier calls. Identical calls reuse the task (`reused=true`); changed arguments fail. Normal validation applies. Bindings last only in this instance until task pruning or restart; worker effects are not exactly-once.

`check_task` / `get_result` on a task owned by another Bridge instance answer from `state.json` — with `from_state: true` and `silent_for_sec: null` — but `wait_task` / `cancel_task` still require the owning instance.
